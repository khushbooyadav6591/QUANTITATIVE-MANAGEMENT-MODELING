**1. The Hope Valley Health Care Association owns and operates six nursing homes in adjoining states. An evaluation of their efficiency has been undertaken using two inputs and two outputs. The inputs are staffing labor (measured in average hours per day) and the cost of supplies (in thousands of dollars per day). The outputs are the number of patient-days reimbursed by third-party sources and the number of patient-days reimbursed privately. A summary of performance data is shown in the table below. **

Using Benchmarking Library for DEA

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(Benchmarking) #comparison of performance measures between similar entities against recognized standards
library(readxl) # for loading from the excelsheet data(Hope Valley Health Care Association) for DEA analysis
```

Now, we read our input data_DEA. We will read the data_DEA from an excel file.

The problem has 6 DMUs with two inputs and two outputs.

**Inputs:** Staffing Labor, Cost of Supplies

**Outputs:** No of patient-days reimbursed by third party, No of patient-days reimbursed privately 


```{r}
#Read the data_DEA from excel file
data_DEA <- read_excel("C:/Users/khush/Documents/DEA.xlsx")
#See the data_DEA
data_DEA
#Facility1 to Facility 6 are the DMUs
DMU_names <- data_DEA[1]
DMU_names
#Lets see the Inputs 
inputs <- data_DEA[c(2,3)]
inputs
#Now, see the outputs
outputs <- data_DEA[c(4,5)]
outputs
#Create the input matrix
input_matrix <- matrix(c(data_DEA$`Staff Hours per Day`,data_DEA$`Supplies per Day`),ncol = 2)
#Lets see the input matrix
input_matrix
#Create the output matrix
output_matrix <- matrix(c(data_DEA$`Reimbursed Patient-Days`,data_DEA$`Privately Paid Patient-Days`),ncol = 2)
#Lets see the output matrix
output_matrix

#plot the graph for Inputs and outputs for better understanding of distribution of data

dea.plot.isoquant(input_matrix[,1],input_matrix[,2]) #inputs

dea.plot.transform(output_matrix[,1],output_matrix[,2]) #outputs
```


Now, let's  run the DEA analysis for different assumptions.

### 1.7. Compare and Contrast the  Results

Let's compare the efficiency of all the DMUs for all the assumptions(tabular and graphical)



```{r}

#Concatenate the Efficiency of all the DMU's

Efficiency_Report <- cbind(FDH_efficiency$eff,CRS_efficiency$eff,VRS_efficiency$eff,IRS_efficiency$eff,DRS_efficiency$eff,FRH_efficiency$eff) 

#Name the rows
rownames(Efficiency_Report) <- c("Facility1","Facility2","Facility3","Facility4","Facility5","Facility6")

#Name the columns
colnames(Efficiency_Report) <- c ("FDH","CRS","VRS","IRS","DRS","FRH")

#See the result
Efficiency_Report

#plot the graph

barplot(t(Efficiency_Report),xlab = "DMUs", ylab="Efficiency",beside=TRUE,main = "Efficiency Comparison",legend.text = TRUE,args.legend = list(x = "center",
                           inset = c(- 0.10, 0)) )


```


**Results:**

* Successfully able to use 'Benchmarking ' library for DEA analysis by comparing performance measures.

* Successfully performed all 6 model assumptions for DEA analysis for all facilities(1-6).
Based on the comparison , we can say that:-

 * **Facility 1,2,3,4** are **fully efficient** for all the assumptions.


 * **Facility 5** is fully efficient for FDH, VRS, IRS and FRH assumptions. For assumptions **DRS and CRS, it is 97.7% efficient**.

 * **Facility 6** is fully efficient for FDH and FRS assumptions. **For CRS and DRS assumptions, it is 86.7% efficient. For IRS and VRS assumptions, it is 89.6% efficient**.

**2.The Research and Development Division of the Emax Corporation has developed three new products. A decision now** **needs to be made on which mix of these products should be produced. Management wants primary consideration given to three factors: total profit, stability in the workforce, and achieving an increase in the company’s earnings** 
**next year from the $75 million achieved this year. In particular, using the units given in the following table, they want to** 
 
**Maximize Z = P - 6C - 3D, where**  
 
**P = total (discounted) profit over the life of the new products,** 
**C	= change (in either direction) in the current level of employment,** 
**D	= decrease (if any) in next year’s earnings from the current year’s level.** 
 
**The amount of any increase in earnings does not enter into Z, because management is concerned primarily with just achieving some increase to keep the stockholders happy. (It has mixed feelings about a large increase that then would be difficult to surpass in subsequent years.)** 
 
**The impact of each of the new products (per unit rate of production) on each of these factors is shown in the following table:**


![](C:/Users/khush/Documents/images/Assignment_5_questrion2.PNG)

**1) Define y1+ and y1-, respectively, as the amount over (if any) and the amount under (if any) the employment level goal. Define y2+ and y2- in the same way for the goal regarding earnings next year. Define x1, x2, and x3 as the production rates of Products 1, 2, and 3, respectively. With these definitions, use the goal programming technique to express y1+, y1- , y2+ and y2-  algebraically in terms of x1, x2, and x3. Also express P in terms of x1, x2, and x3.** 

 **Solution:**

This problem has all the Goals which are roughly comparable importance. Hence, it is a **non preemptive goal programming model**.

The Emax corporation problem includes all three possible types of goals: an upper, one-sided goal (Total profit); a two-sided goal (Employment level); and a lower, one-sided goal (Earnings Next year). Let the decision variables be x1, x2, x3 be the production rates of products 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Therefore, Total Profit (P) can be expressed in terms of x1, x2 and x3 as:

|              Maximize = 20x1+15x2+25x3

Similarly, Employment level and Next year Earnings goals can be expressed as:

|               6x1+4x2+5x3 =50

|               x1+7x2+5x3 >=75

As mentioned above , goal of total profit is to maximize it using the employment level and next years earnings goals as constrains, so these goals can be stated as

|               Max z: 20x1+15x2+25x3

|                s.t.: 6x1+4x2+5x3 =50

|                      8x1+7x2+5x3 >=75

Now, we need to use **auxilliary variables**,To express this *overall objective mathematically**,(extra variables that are helpful for formulating the model) y1 and y2, defined as follows:

|               **y1=6x1+4x2+5x3-50**    (Employment Level minus the target)

|               **y2=8x1+7x2+5x3-75**    (Earnings Next Year minus the Target)

Since, each yi can be either positive or negative,we will replace each one by the difference of two non negative variables:

|               **y1=y1p - y1m,  where y1p , y1m >=0**


|               **y2=y2p - y2m,  where y2p , y2m >=0**



**y1p** represents the penalty for **employment level goal exceeding 50** and **y1m** is the penalty for employment level **goal decreasing below 50**. 


Similarly, **y2m** will be the penalty for **not reaching the next year earnings** and **y2p** will be **exceeding the next year earnings.** 

***

**2) Express management’s objective function in terms of x1, x2, x3, y1+, y1- , y2+ and y2-. 3) Formulate and solve the linear programming model. What are your findings? **


Now, we can apply the new auxiliary vairables and therefore the overall management's objective function will be expressed mathematically as (maximizing the profit and subtracting the penalties) :

|               **Max z: 20x1+15x2+25x3-6y1p-6y1m-3y2m;**

|                **s.t.: 6x1+4x2+5x3-y1p+y1m =50**

|                      **8x1+7x2+5x3-y2p+y2m >=75**


Since, there is no penalty for exceeding the earnings next year, so y2p should not appear in the objective function.

Now,let's solve this Linear programming model using lpSolveAPI on R.


### 2.1. Solving the Emax linear programming model using lpsolveAPI

```{r,message=FALSE}

# loading the lpsolveAPI library
library(lpSolveAPI)

## Let us set up the Emax problem with 7 decision variables, and 2 constraints. 
lprec <- make.lp(2, 7)

## Set the maximization objective function
set.objfn(lprec, c(20, 15, 25, -6, -6, 0, -3))
lp.control(lprec,sense='max')

# Set values for the rows (set the Left hand side constraints)
set.row(lprec, 1, c(6, 4, 5, -1 , 1, 0, 0), indices = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7))
set.row(lprec, 2, c(8, 7, 5,0,0,-1,1), indices = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7))

# Set the right hand side values
rhs <- c(50, 75)
set.rhs(lprec, rhs)

# Set constraint type and set variable types and bound
set.constr.type(lprec, c("=", ">="))
set.bounds(lprec, lower = rep(0, 7))

# Naming the decision variables (column) and constraints (rows)

lp.rownames <- c("EmploymentLevelGoal", "NextYearEarningsGoal")
lp.colnames <- c("x1", "x2", "x3","y1p", "y1m", "y2p","y2m")
dimnames(lprec) <- list(lp.rownames, lp.colnames)

# View the linear program object
lprec

# Save this into a file
write.lp(lprec, filename = "emax.lp", type = "lp")

# Now solve the model
solve(lprec)

# Show the value of objective function, variables, constraints and slack
get.objective(lprec)
get.variables(lprec)
get.constraints(lprec)
get.constraints(lprec) - rhs

```


Also,We can now read the lp formulation using an lp file and solve it. I am using the same lp file which I have saved above.

### 2.2 Solving the lp file 
```{r}
emax <- read.lp("emax.lp")    # create an lp object x
solve(emax)                   # Solution
get.objective(emax)           # get objective value
get.variables(emax)           # get values of decision variables
get.constraints(emax)         # get constraints
```

#### **Observations:**

* After applying the simplex method to the above formulation yields an optimal solution **x1 = 0, x2 = 0, x3 = 15, y1p = 25, y1m = 0, y2p = 0, y2m = 0.** 

* We can see that, **y1 = 25 and y2 = 0**, so the second goal of Next years Earning is fully satisfied, but the **employment level goal of 50 is exceeded by 25 (2500 Employees)**.

* **The resulting penalty for deviating from the goals is 150**.Therefore, value for the **objective function is 225**.

* This solution is **not feasible**.


***


### 2.3 Streamlined Procedure for Preemptive Goal Programming

Since , there is no priority given by the management and  in order to get a feasible solution we can use The **Streamlined Procedure for Preemptive Goal Programming.**

Now we need to re-formulate the objective function by assigning different penalty weights.A very large positive number can be substituted for penality.(here I have  used 1000):


            Max z: 20x1+15x2+25x3-6000y1p-6000y1m-3000y2m; 

                     s.t.: 6x1+4x2+5x3-y1p+y1m =50
                     
                           8x1+7x2+5x3-y2p+y2m >=75
                     

Now, we will solve the lp file with the above mentioned equations in R and validate the result.

```{r}
abc <- read.lp("New_Formulated_emax.lp")    # create an lp object x
abc
solve(abc)                   # Solution
get.objective(abc)           # get objective value
get.variables(abc)           # get values of decision variables
get.constraints(abc) 
```
#### **Results:**

* I was able to understand that Goal programming is an approach of deriving a best possible 'satisfactory' level of goal attainment by multi-objective optimization problem that balances a trade-off in conflicting by solving  objectives.

*  In the first objective function **Employment level goal of 50 was exceeded by 25 (2500 Employees)** and solution was **not feasible**.

* After applying streamlined procedure we are getting a **feasible solution**.

* After applying this method to the above formulation yields an optimal solution **x1 = 0, x2 = 8.4(relatively), x3 = 3.4(relatively), y1p = 0, y1m = 0, y2p = 0, y2m = 0.** 

* We can see that, **y1 = 0 and y2 = 0**, so the both goals are **fully satisfied** now.

* The value for the **objective function is 208.3333**.
